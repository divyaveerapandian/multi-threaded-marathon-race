# multi-threaded-marathon-race
Marathon Race Application simulated by Java Threads

Runners are configured with different speed and rest time. Once the application is 
started, the players( the threads) start running(based on configured speed of the 
player) and take rest in between (depending on configured rest time); the player 
who completes the race first will be the winner.
Used Derby database, XML file and Text file as the data source.
